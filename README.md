# WOXSEN LEAGUE — Sports Facility Booking System

Woxsen League is a **web-based sports booking prototype** built to improve how sports facilities are booked and managed on campus.

The project was created to replace a manual, paper-based booking process with a clearer, fairer, and more traceable digital system. This repository represents a **fully functioning prototype**, built for academic and demonstration purposes, not a production deployment.

## 📌 Overview

At the time of the project, sports facilities at Woxsen University were booked by physically visiting the SportsX facility and writing names in a register. This process was:

* time-consuming
* prone to conflicts
* difficult to track or verify

Woxsen League was built to solve this by introducing **online slot booking**, visibility into availability, and a digital record of who booked what and when.

An additional idea explored was the use of a **QR-based ticket system**, allowing admins to verify bookings easily.

## 👥 Users

* Students
* Faculty
* Campus sports administrators

Anyone eligible to use campus sports facilities could book slots through the system.

## 🧠 My Role

This was a team project under the team name **SOCH**.

My contribution focused on **system-level thinking and feature ideation**, including:

* designing the sports card layout on user profiles
* shaping the booking history flow
* proposing the QR-code based booking verification
* contributing to overall system design decisions

While I was not the primary implementer, I was actively involved in defining how the system should behave and scale.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Online Slot Booking:** Book sports slots digitally without visiting SportsX
* **Availability View:** Clear visibility into available and occupied slots
* **Booking History:** Users can see their past and upcoming bookings
* **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can view who booked which slot and when
* **QR Code Tickets (Prototype):** Generated after booking for quick verification
* **Conflict Reduction:** Eliminates disputes by maintaining a single source of truth

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Software)

* **Frontend:** React
* **Database:** Used for storing bookings, users, and slot data
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🔧 Hardest Technical Challenge

One of the most challenging aspects of the project was conceptualizing and integrating the **QR-code based booking flow**.

This involved thinking through:

* how tickets should be generated after booking
* how admins would scan and verify them
* how QR codes tie back to booking records

Designing the **sports cards** and ensuring booking information was presented clearly without clutter was another important challenge.

## 🎯 What I’m Proud Of

* contributing system-level ideas to improve fairness and clarity
* helping shape features that reduce real user frustration
* exploring QR-based verification instead of manual checks
* being part of a team that built a usable, end-to-end prototype

---

## 📚 Learnings

* manual processes break down at scale
* system design decisions matter even before writing code
* small UX features can prevent large real-world conflicts
* collaboration is as important as individual contribution

Woxsen League reinforced how thoughtful system design can simplify everyday campus problems.
